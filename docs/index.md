features:
  - title: Split by design
    details: Slide copy lives in presentation.yaml. Numbers and release metadata live in generated.yaml so humans and automation do not fight over the same lines.
  - title: Actually static
    details: The CLI emits a dist directory you can host anywhere. No Node server in production unless you want one for previews.
  - title: One toolpath
    details: Init a tree, validate YAML, build, serve locally, and optionally fetch GitHub-backed data into generated.yaml—all from the same CLI.

## Where to go next

The [quickstart](/quickstart) gets you from `npx @slide-spec/cli init` to a served site. If you already have files open, the [schema](/schema/) pages describe every document, [templates](/templates/) map each slide layout, and the [CLI reference](/cli/) lists commands and flags without extra narration.

Contribution policy and license live in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lreading/slide-spec) (`README`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`) so this site stays a single technical surface.
