# Product Management Review

A quarterly product review for an internal SaaS platform. This example shows how Slide Spec works for product teams tracking milestones, epics, customer feedback, and team spotlights - with no GitHub data at all.

The full YAML for this example lives in the [`examples/product-review`](https://github.com/lreading/slide-spec/tree/main/examples/product-review) directory.

## The scenario

Meridian is a fictional project management SaaS. The product team publishes quarterly reviews to share what shipped, what the metrics look like, and where the roadmap is headed. All data is hand-authored from Jira exports and internal dashboards.

## Site configuration

Note how the three required links point to Jira, an internal wiki, and a roadmap page rather than GitHub. The `project_badge` marks this as an internal-only site.

```yaml
site:
  title: Meridian Product Reviews
  project_badge:
    label: Internal
    fa_icon: fa-lock
    icon_position: before
  home_hero:
    title_primary: Meridian
    title_accent: Reviews
    subtitle: Product Team
  home_intro: Quarterly product reviews for the Meridian platform team.
  home_cta_label: View latest review
  presentations_cta_label: View all reviews
  links:
    repository:
      label: Jira Board
      url: https://meridian.atlassian.net/browse/MER
      eyebrow: Project Tracker
    docs:
      label: Product Wiki
      url: https://meridian.example.com/wiki
      eyebrow: Documentation
    owasp:
      label: Roadmap
      url: https://meridian.example.com/roadmap
      eyebrow: Planning
```

### Key metrics (metrics-and-links)

Product health metrics sourced from Jira and customer surveys. The `stat_keys` reference arbitrary metric ids in `generated.yaml`.

  title: Key metrics
  subtitle: Product health signals from Q1
  content:
    section_heading: Customer signals
    stats_heading: This quarter
    trend_suffix: vs Q4 2025

    stat_keys:

      - bugs_resolved
    mentions:
      - type: Customer feedback

### Generated data

Metrics use product-specific keys like `stories_completed` and `customer_nps`. Releases track product milestones instead of git tags.
