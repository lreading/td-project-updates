# Community & DevRel Update

A quarterly community update from a developer relations team. This example shows how Slide Spec works for DevRel teams tracking community growth, events, content, and champion spotlights.

The full YAML for this example lives in the [`examples/community-update`](https://github.com/lreading/slide-spec/tree/main/examples/community-update) directory.

## The scenario

The Prism Collective is a fictional developer community. The DevRel team publishes quarterly updates covering conference appearances, content releases, community champions, and engagement metrics. All data is hand-authored.

## Slides

### Hero

<figure class="template-doc-shot">
  <img src="/screenshots/examples/comm-hero.png" alt="Prism Community hero slide" />

### What happened (section-list-grid)

Conference circuit, learning paths, and SDK launches. Note how the section-list-grid template works for non-engineering content like events and educational resources.

### Community health (metrics-and-links)

Engagement metrics like forum members, events held, and SDK downloads. Mentions highlight testimonials and media coverage.
