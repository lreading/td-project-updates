# Security Posture Report

A quarterly security readout for engineering leadership. This example shows how Slide Spec works for security teams tracking vulnerabilities, compliance progress, patches, and remediation priorities.

The full YAML for this example lives in the [`examples/security-posture`](https://github.com/lreading/slide-spec/tree/main/examples/security-posture) directory.

## The scenario

Sentinel Corp's security team publishes quarterly posture reports. The data comes from internal vulnerability scanners, compliance dashboards, and audit findings - all hand-authored into `generated.yaml`.

## Site configuration

The three required links point to an internal security dashboard, policy documentation, and the OWASP Top 10 reference. The badge marks the content as confidential.

```yaml

### Security metrics (metrics-and-links)

Metrics track vulnerability remediation, patch times, compliance controls, and audit findings. Mentions reference compliance certifications.
